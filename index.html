			 <p>So, Elon want&rsquo;s to transform Twitter into &ldquo;everything app&rdquo; X (handle all our shopping, banking, messaging, etc.), plant a microchip to our brains, build an AI that understands the universe and then.. when it all goes south, escape to space in a 🚀? 😅🤪</p>

			 <p>Made some minor(ish) design tweaks to the <a href="https://juhaliikala.com/">blog</a> today. New background from Santorini trip, of course! 😄 Also, dropped the newsletter subscribe option for now. I personally feel it doesn&rsquo;t make much sense to send these (mostly) microblog type of posts via email (even if gathered in weekly emails). RSS feels like a better channel for those imho.</p>
<p>I wonder how others feel about this? Do you subscibe to email updates if the posts are mostly microblog type of posts?</p>

			 <p>Well, I did it again. Started a new blog, that is.</p>
<p>Oh wait, that&rsquo;s not entirely true. It ain&rsquo;t new, as I&rsquo;ve used it on and off for micro blogging. But I haven&rsquo;t used it for longer posts like this one. Oh, and it has fresh coat of paint too!</p>
<p>The site runs on <em>micro.blog</em>, a blogging platform that also has elements of social networking built in. In addition to the micro.blog community itself, it also connects with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fediverse">Fediverse</a>. And you can easily cross-publish to other social networks, including LinkedIn, Twitter, Medium and more.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s neat, <a href="https://micro.blog">do check it out</a>.</p>
<p>Now that I&rsquo;ve moved around some &ldquo;furniture&rdquo;, this place feels more like home. There are few things I&rsquo;d like to mention about the &ldquo;making of&rdquo; this site.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>First, I&rsquo;d like to send out big thanks to <a href="https://micro.blog/Mtt">@Mtt</a>, who created a micro.blog theme called <a href="https://github.com/MattSLangford/Tiny-Theme-for-Micro.blog">Tiny Theme</a>. This site is using a (yours truly) modified version of Tiny that turned out rather lovely I think. :)</p>
<p>Second, I&rsquo;d like to thank <a href="https://micro.blog/manton">@manton</a> and the whole team micro.blog for creating such an unique blogging platform. There really ain&rsquo;t another one like it.</p>
<p>Third, check out this site&rsquo;s <a href="/colophon">colophon</a> for the rest of building blocks this site uses. I&rsquo;ll do my best to keep that page updated when things change here.</p>
<p>Last, but not least - As micro.blog also provides <a href="https://micro.blog/pricing">Newsletter feature</a>, I&rsquo;m trying that out as a delivery mechanism for sharing monthly updates from this blog. If it turns out to be sufficient for my use, great! If not, I&rsquo;m happy to keep using <a href="https://buttondown.email/">Buttondown</a> (which I&rsquo;ve used in the past). Whatever works best et cetera.</p>
<p>P.S. Oh, and if RSS feeds are more your thing, feel free to pick the one(s) that make most sense to you:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://juhaliikala.com/feed.xml">Full RSS feed (all posts and notes)</a></li>
<li><a href="https://juhaliikala.com/categories/article/feed.xml">Long-form posts (like this one)</a></li>
<li><a href="https://juhaliikala.com/categories/monthly-wrap/feed.xml">The monthly wrap</a></li>
</ul>
<p>P.P.S If you&rsquo;re on Fediverse (Mastodon, for example), you can also follow what happens here on blog by searching for this handle: <strong>@juha@juhaliikala.com</strong>. All the things you see here (as notes and posts), will end up on that account&rsquo;s feed.</p>
<p>Ok, I think that&rsquo;s all for now. Thank you for reading and I hope to &ldquo;see you&rdquo; again next time here on blog. Cheers! 👋</p>

			 <p>Third time&rsquo;s the charm? 😄 To get better aligned with the whole Fediverse concept, I aliased my Mastodon account (@juhaliikala@me.dm) once more and will be using <a href="https://micro.blog/juha@juhaliikala.com">@juha@juhaliikala.com</a> as my &ldquo;main Fediverse home&rdquo; from now until eternity (I hope!).

I guess that&rsquo;s one way to go about it? :)</p>

Oli miten oli, ajatus olisi välillä jakaa täällä jotain suomeksikin, tai viritellä cross-postausta micro.blogista esim.

			 <p>Does anyone run their micro.blog in some other language than English? I&rsquo;m considering creating another micro.blog which I&rsquo;d use for Finnish content specifically. There are cases where blogging in my native language would make sense (and sharing those post to social channels which I use in Finnish). Would be cool to hear some experiences if some of you&rsquo;ve done something similar! :)</p>

			 <p>For many years, it has been my December activity to go through those web/social media accounts that I don&rsquo;t really use much and &ldquo;cut out the fat&rdquo;. It&rsquo;s always a surprise to realize how many new places I&rsquo;ve made accounts during the past year (as I like to test new shiny things 😄).</p>
<p>This year, I&rsquo;d especially like to get the number of my social media accounts as low as possible. Ideally, I would just like to be &ldquo;present&rdquo; on my own website/blog and cut out all the rest. I feel that&rsquo;s not yet entirely viable option, although the #ActivityPub &ldquo;movement&rdquo; sure has helped get the ball rolling in that direction.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s see! At least, there&rsquo;s this one &ldquo;bird account&rdquo; that I very much think will get flushed by the end of year for me. Probably few others too. Anyone else who&rsquo;s doing a similar &ldquo;cleanup&rdquo; this year?</p>

			 <p>I find that micro.blog has the same kind of good vibe Twitter used to have in the early days. Browsing and reading other people&rsquo;s updates here leave me feeling good. The opposite is true with my Twitter feed, which has turned into (mostly) doom and gloom, people arguing about stupid smallest things and all that. I&rsquo;ll be spending much more time here than on Twitter in the future, that&rsquo;s for sure! :)</p>
<p>One thing I&rsquo;ve wondered lately when discovering new users here, how many active users are there on micro.blog? Just a curiosity, if it&rsquo;s not a big secret <a href="https://micro.blog/manton">@manton</a>? 😄</p>

			 <p>Hi <a href="https://micro.blog/jeffmueller">@jeffmueller</a>! Is <a href="https://adnfinder.herokuapp.com">ADN finder</a> still a thing? I was trying to add myself to that list, but I don&rsquo;t think it worked out. Or is there a manual process involved after submitting? 😊 Cheers!</p>

			 <p>Where did that weekend go? 😄 Well, coffee to the engine and toward this weeks adventures! Started exploring <a href="https://convertkit.com">ConvertKit</a> on Saturday. Thinking of starting a newsletter, in addition to these somewhat random micro blog writings. Let&rsquo;s see!</p>

			 <p>Giving a try to &ldquo;Twitter for Professionals&rdquo; mode in the app. Could not find software developer, maker or creator &ldquo;profession&rdquo; there, so ended up using &ldquo;Blogger&rdquo; 😄 Let&rsquo;s see how this feature turns out! 😆</p>

			 <p>And there goes the well started Daily (Micro) Blogger streak - Forgot to post yesterday, duh! Oh well.. 😄 Weekend ahead! No plans, just chill! Maybe some gym activities, movies and catching up reading from some favourite bloggers around the blogosphere. Speaking of &ldquo;reading blogs&rdquo;, I still find most convinient to subscribe to blogs via news reader, instead of email newsletters. My highest recommends goes to reader called <a href="https://netnewswire.com/">NetNewsWire</a> 🙌</p>

			 <p>My first Micro Monday shout-out goes to <a href="https://micro.blog/amit">@amit</a> who&rsquo;s blog <a href="https://www.amitgawande.com">amitgawande.com</a> I just stumbled upon recently. Amit sure has been blogging for a while!  Starting from 2005, that&rsquo;s no small feat! 😄 Amit is also responsible for the beautiful theme I started using on my blog (the same one he uses for his - <a href="https://github.com/am1t/microdotblog-paper">Paper theme</a>). Minimally beautiful!</p>
<p>Regarding discovering new (micro) blogs, I wonder if there&rsquo;s a way to see if anyone I follow on Twitter has a blog here? Is there a plug-in or something for that <a href="https://micro.blog/manton">@manton</a>? 😊</p>

			 <p>Really wish there were a lite version of the Instagram iOS app. NO REELS, suggestions,  boosted posts, ads, shopping features.. all that. Just photos and perhaps, stories. Just the good stuff from the people you follow, nothing else. Well, not going to happen for sure.. but one can always hope! 😄</p>

			 <p>No <a href="https://www.juhaliikala.com/2022/08/14/this-evening-i.html">Twitter backup</a> quite yet, so won&rsquo;t be putting up the &ldquo;gone fishing sign&rdquo; today at least 😁 In the meantime, I might just spend some time and tune up micro.blog styles and settings. That should be a good exercise for this evening!</p>

			 <p>This evening I find myself seriously contemplating the idea of quitting Twitter. OR at least hanging a virtual &ldquo;gone to fishing, might or might not come back&rdquo; sign on my profile. 😅</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been years since I last enjoyed using the platform. I guess it mostly feels like a distraction today. I certainly use too much screentime on it at least, with very little actual usefulness or value.</p>
<p>Just started the process of getting my tweet archive ready for download. Going to sleep on it and see what the next steps will be once the archive is ready. 🙈</p>

			 <p>After a brief <a href="https://www.juhaliikala.com/2022/04/09/back-to-micro.html">sidetracking on WordPress</a>, I switched my blogging efforts back to micro.blog. WP was fine (it always is), but the ease of publishing via micro.blog just felt like a better road to take right now. Let&rsquo;s see how this goes! :)</p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;ve been mulling over the thought of building and selling a few website / blogging themes this year. Just not 100% decided on to which &ldquo;platform&rdquo;. Probably <a href="https://ghost.org/">Ghost</a> or <a href="https://www.11ty.dev/">Eleventy</a>, or why not a micro.blog theme even? WordPress could be too, but the latest full site editing / block theme stuff feels like there&rsquo;s too many moving parts to take into account. Would want to keep things as simple as possible.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t recall if I&rsquo;ve seen commercial Eleventy themes before though. So Ghost then.. perhaps? At least Ghost has a <a href="https://ghost.org/themes/?category=paid">theme marketplace</a>.</p>
<p>Just thinking out loud here I guess. Let&rsquo;s see what I manage to cook up (if anything at all)! :)</p>

			 <p>Back to micro posting! While putting bits and pieces together <a href="https://www.juhaliikala.com/">on my personal blog</a>, I also wanted to start writing note type of (micro) posts. For me the reasoning being - that would lower the otherwise high threshold of hitting the publish button more often. So here goes! :)</p>
