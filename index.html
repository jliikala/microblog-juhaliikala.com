			 <p>So, as we now have three main ways for subscribing to a blog/publication; email newsletter, RSS and ActivityPub (handle), which will win? Some blogs even add a fourth way: Subscribing via WhatsApp / Telegram / Etc. Will RSS and ActivityPub subscribing continue being marginal use case and email still rules? I have no idea, but I think about this a lot.</p>
<p>I feel ActivityPub (especially in it&rsquo;s current form) has a bit similar problem that RSS does, non-techical users just don&rsquo;t use them for subscribing. It&rsquo;s been all about newsletters for so long, that not sure if that mental model will change easily.</p>
<p>As a blogger, do you intend to support several different ways of subscribing (to your blog)? Or, do you plan to just promote one primary way of subscribing and maybe offer the other ways of subscribing in &ldquo;the fine details&rdquo;?</p>

			 <p>I miss those early days when most people I know from blogging, web projects, online biz and related endeavours were on Twitter. Both in Finland and globally. It was so easy to connect and stay connected with everyone.</p>
<p>Fast forward to today, and we are all scattered across various social networks online. Mastodon, Instagram, LinkedIn, Threads, Tumblr, Bluesky, micro.blog.. and yes, X.</p>
<p>Ugh. Too many places to keep track of, let alone stay active on. ActivityPub certainly is a step in the right direction in this context, but will it ever get adopted widely enough to &ldquo;solve&rdquo; this problem?</p>
<p>I guess only time will tell.  ü§∑üèª</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>Right before heading to summer holidays in June, <a href="https://juhaliikala.com/2023/06/07/papas-got-a.html">I launched a new version of this website</a>.</p>
<p>During the holiday, I didn&rsquo;t do much else than enjoy the vacation views &amp; feels and post some stories and photos <a href="https://www.instagram.com/nomadcouch/">on Instagram</a> from the trip. Didn&rsquo;t even bring my laptop with me, holiday well spent!</p>
<p>Having said that, I feel excited to get back to tinkering with this blog again. Unlike social media channels where you have limited options on &ldquo;making it yours&rdquo;, on personal websites, the sky is the limit. It&rsquo;s fun being able to make this thing whatever I want it to be.</p>
<p>Oh, where did we travel?</p>
<p>In addition to travels in Finland (where I&rsquo;m from), we went to Northern Italy, near a city called Bolzano and from there, continued to Santorini, Greece. First mountain views with nice 20-25 Celsius weather, then full on sunshine, 30 Celsius and those beautiful Santorini views. It was great and I miss those places already!</p>
<p>Ok, but about that blog / website tinkering topic. Here&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s been happening.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<h2 id="more-layout-changes">More layout changes</h2>
<p>I started building this website on a fork of <a href="https://github.com/MattSLangford/Tiny-Theme-for-Micro.blog">Tiny Theme</a> in June. After that, this has <em>evolved</em> on a theme of it&rsquo;s own. I&rsquo;ll probably make a new repository out of this at some point and write it again from scratch at some point. But for now, the code itself is living on the fork branch.</p>
<p>When viewing the site on larger screens, it now has a left sidebar and the main content area on right. On mobile, it&rsquo;s the same one column view it used to be.</p>
<p>There are also some subtle new things like the subscribe to email updates and RSS feed buttons on homesite. I also added a <em>verified checkmark</em> icon next to my name on site title. If you&rsquo;d like to add it to your personal blog, <a href="https://andy-bell.co.uk/why-pay-8-for-a-check-mark-when-you-can-get-one-for-for-free/">Andy Bell got you covered</a>.</p>
<h2 id="subscribing-to-blog-updates-revisited">Subscribing to blog updates, revisited</h2>
<p>I struggled quite a bit on the question of &ldquo;how does one want to follow updates from a blog&rdquo;. Especially when the blog has both micro posts (which get published often) and long form content (like this article).</p>
<p>I first thought of a monthly newsletter option, then a weekly version of it. But it felt strange for me to be sending a collection of all the posts from a given time frame. I wouldn&rsquo;t want to subscribe via email to anyone&rsquo;s Twitter/Threads/Mastodon feed either, so why would this feel any different?</p>
<p>For more regular updates, RSS feels like a better option. Or following the blog on Fediverse (seeing all the post updates from a social media channel of user&rsquo;s choice, Mastodon for example).</p>
<p>What I ended up with are these three options:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sending long form articles (and only those) via email as soon as they get published. You can <a href="https://juhaliikala.com/subscribe/">subscribe here</a>.</li>
<li>Full feed (with long and short posts) are available via <a href="https://juhaliikala.com/feed.xml">RSS</a>.</li>
<li>Following on Fediverse by searching <a href="https://micro.blog/juha@juhaliikala.com">@juha@juhaliikala.com</a> (copy-paste that to Mastodon search and you follow this blog via that channel)</li>
</ul>
<p>I also thought about sending real time blog notification via Slack / Telegram, etc. but didn&rsquo;t yet implement any of that. Let&rsquo;s see if I will.</p>
<h2 id="more-blogging">More blogging</h2>
<p>Back in 2010, I used write one or two article per week and publish them. Fast forward to this day and I really struggle to write and publish once a month (if even that!). Why is that?</p>
<p>There are many things I could point my finger at and cast blame: Too busy at work and life, too many distractions (mostly all the social media channels, news etc.), too much this and that. But yeah, it is what it is. Life is much more hectic than it used to be back then.</p>
<p>To that end, I&rsquo;d still like to at least try my best to publish here on a biweekly basis, if possible. If not, oh well.. it gets out when it gets out, I guess. My website, my rules and all that ü§™.</p>
<h2 id="the-story-continues">The story continues..</h2>
<p>Speaking of hectic life, I&rsquo;m already late from my daily(ish) workout session, so need to run now.</p>
<p>But hopefully will <em>see you soon</em> again here on blog. Until the next time! üëã</p>

New background from Santorini trip, of course! üòÑ Also, dropped the newsletter subscribe option for now. I personally feel it doesn&rsquo;t make much sense to send these (mostly) microblog type of posts via email (even if gathered in weekly emails). RSS feels like a better channel for those imho.</p>
<p>I wonder how others feel about this? Do you subscibe to email updates if the posts are mostly microblog type of posts?</p>

			 <p>Well, I did it again. Started a new blog, that is.</p>
<p>Oh wait, that&rsquo;s not entirely true. It ain&rsquo;t new, as I&rsquo;ve used it on and off for micro blogging. But I haven&rsquo;t used it for longer posts like this one. Oh, and it has fresh coat of paint too!</p>
<p>The site runs on <em>micro.blog</em>, a blogging platform that also has elements of social networking built in. In addition to the micro.blog community itself, it also connects with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fediverse">Fediverse</a>. And you can easily cross-publish to other social networks, including LinkedIn, Twitter, Medium and more.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s neat, <a href="https://micro.blog">do check it out</a>.</p>
<p>Now that I&rsquo;ve moved around some &ldquo;furniture&rdquo;, this place feels more like home. There are few things I&rsquo;d like to mention about the &ldquo;making of&rdquo; this site.</p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>First, I&rsquo;d like to send out big thanks to <a href="https://micro.blog/Mtt">@Mtt</a>, who created a micro.blog theme called <a href="https://github.com/MattSLangford/Tiny-Theme-for-Micro.blog">Tiny Theme</a>. This site is using a (yours truly) modified version of Tiny that turned out rather lovely I think. :)</p>
<p>Second, I&rsquo;d like to thank <a href="https://micro.blog/manton">@manton</a> and the whole team micro.blog for creating such an unique blogging platform. There really ain&rsquo;t another one like it.</p>
<p>Third, check out this site&rsquo;s <a href="/colophon">colophon</a> for the rest of building blocks this site uses. I&rsquo;ll do my best to keep that page updated when things change here.</p>
<p>Last, but not least - As micro.blog also provides <a href="https://micro.blog/pricing">Newsletter feature</a>, I&rsquo;m trying that out as a delivery mechanism for sending new articles from this blog. If it turns out to be sufficient for my use, great! If not, I&rsquo;m happy to keep using <a href="https://buttondown.email/">Buttondown</a> (which I&rsquo;ve used in the past). Whatever works best et cetera.</p>
<p><em>Edit Jul 29th, 2023</em>: Micro.blog&rsquo;s newsletter feature worked great, but I decided to go back to Buttondown still, as it provides more useful features I can tinker with. Will stick with that for now. If you&rsquo;d like, <a href="https://juhaliikala.com/subscribe/">you can subscribe here</a>.</p>
<p>P.S. Oh, and if RSS feeds are more your thing, feel free to pick the one(s) that make most sense to you:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://juhaliikala.com/feed.xml">Full RSS feed (all posts and notes)</a></li>
<li><a href="https://juhaliikala.com/categories/article/feed.xml">Long-form posts (like this one)</a></li>
</ul>
<p>P.P.S If you&rsquo;re on Fediverse (Mastodon, for example), you can also follow what happens here on blog by searching for this handle: <strong>@juha@juhaliikala.com</strong>. All the things you see here (as notes and posts), will end up on that account&rsquo;s feed.</p>
<p>Ok, I think that&rsquo;s all for now. Thank you for reading and I hope to &ldquo;see you&rdquo; again next time here on blog. Cheers! üëã</p>

			 <p>Still wrapping my head around the &ldquo;best practice&rdquo; on how to use my <a href="https://masto.ai/@juhaliikala">main Mastodon account</a> and this blog&rsquo;s &ldquo;account&rdquo; (@juha@juhaliikala.com) side by side. For now, I think I&rsquo;ll just boost posts that I&rsquo;d also like to share via my main account and keep my fingers crossed that the possible comments on the (boosted) post appear hear on this blog (and micro.blog) too. I guess that&rsquo;s one way to go about it? :)</p>

			 <p>Does anyone run their micro.blog in some other language than English? I&rsquo;m considering creating another micro.blog which I&rsquo;d use for Finnish content specifically. There are cases where blogging in my native language would make sense (and sharing those post to social channels which I use in Finnish). Would be cool to hear some experiences if some of you&rsquo;ve done something similar! :)</p>

			 <p>For many years, it has been my December activity to go through those web/social media accounts that I don&rsquo;t really use much and &ldquo;cut out the fat&rdquo;. It&rsquo;s always a surprise to realize how many new places I&rsquo;ve made accounts during the past year (as I like to test new shiny things üòÑ).</p>
<p>This year, I&rsquo;d especially like to get the number of my social media accounts as low as possible. Ideally, I would just like to be &ldquo;present&rdquo; on my own website/blog and cut out all the rest. I feel that&rsquo;s not yet entirely viable option, although the #ActivityPub &ldquo;movement&rdquo; sure has helped get the ball rolling in that direction.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s see! At least, there&rsquo;s this one &ldquo;bird account&rdquo; that I very much think will get flushed by the end of year for me. Probably few others too. Anyone else who&rsquo;s doing a similar &ldquo;cleanup&rdquo; this year?</p>

			 <p>I find that micro.blog has the same kind of good vibe Twitter used to have in the early days. Browsing and reading other people&rsquo;s updates here leave me feeling good.

I&rsquo;ll be spending much more time here than on Twitter in the future, that&rsquo;s for sure! :)</p>

<p>Don&rsquo;t recall if I&rsquo;ve seen commercial Eleventy themes before though. So Ghost then.. perhaps? At least Ghost has a <a href="https://ghost.org/themes/?category=paid">theme marketplace</a>.</p>
