			 <p>Yeah, it&rsquo;s time. <a href="https://www.juhaliikala.com/2022/08/14/this-evening-i.html">Gone fishing</a> is now in effect. Been mulling over the though way before the &ldquo;latest developments&rdquo;, but as the feeling has only grown stronger since, it is time. Let&rsquo;s reconsider at some point, maybe.</p>

			 <p>I find that micro.blog has the same kind of good vibe Twitter used to have in the early days. Browsing and reading other people&rsquo;s updates here leave me feeling good. The opposite is true with my Twitter feed, which has turned into (mostly) doom and gloom, people arguing about stupid smallest things and all that. I&rsquo;ll be spending much more time here than on Twitter in the future, that&rsquo;s for sure! :)</p>
<p>One thing I&rsquo;ve wondered lately when discovering new users here, how many active users are there on micro.blog? Just a curiosity, if it&rsquo;s not a big secret <a href="https://micro.blog/manton">@manton</a>? 😄</p>

			 <p>Where did that weekend go? 😄 Well, coffee to the engine and toward this weeks adventures! Started exploring <a href="https://convertkit.com">ConvertKit</a> on Saturday. Thinking of starting a newsletter, in addition to these somewhat random micro blog writings. Let&rsquo;s see!</p>

			 <p>And there goes the well started Daily (Micro) Blogger streak - Forgot to post yesterday, duh! Oh well.. 😄 Weekend ahead! No plans, just chill! Maybe some gym activities, movies and catching up reading from some favourite bloggers around the blogosphere. Speaking of &ldquo;reading blogs&rdquo;, I still find most convinient to subscribe to blogs via news reader, instead of email newsletters. My highest recommends goes to reader called <a href="https://netnewswire.com/">NetNewsWire</a> 🙌</p>

			 <p>Apparently the &ldquo;new hot thing&rdquo; on social media is an app called BeReal. Looked through few demo videos of usage, but haven&rsquo;t tried. Not sure I will.</p>
<p>The idea of sharing random moment daily with friends in kind of fun.. but then again, I really don&rsquo;t feel like needing yet another app in my life. Also, we have groups in various chat apps with friends where we share random moments already, so.. might be a pass for me.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;ve tried / use it already, what are your thoughts of it?</p>

			 <p>My first Micro Monday shout-out goes to <a href="https://micro.blog/amit">@amit</a> who&rsquo;s blog <a href="https://www.amitgawande.com">amitgawande.com</a> I just stumbled upon recently. Amit sure has been blogging for a while!  Starting from 2005, that&rsquo;s no small feat! 😄 Amit is also responsible for the beautiful theme I started using on my blog (the same one he uses for his - <a href="https://github.com/am1t/microdotblog-paper">Paper theme</a>). Minimally beautiful!</p>
<p>Regarding discovering new (micro) blogs, I wonder if there&rsquo;s a way to see if anyone I follow on Twitter has a blog here? Is there a plug-in or something for that <a href="https://micro.blog/manton">@manton</a>? 😊</p>

			 <p>Really wish there were a lite version of the Instagram iOS app. NO REELS, suggestions,  boosted posts, ads, shopping features.. all that. Just photos and perhaps, stories. Just the good stuff from the people you follow, nothing else. Well, not going to happen for sure.. but one can always hope! 😄</p>

			 <p>No <a href="https://www.juhaliikala.com/2022/08/14/this-evening-i.html">Twitter backup</a> quite yet, so won&rsquo;t be putting up the &ldquo;gone fishing sign&rdquo; today at least 😁 In the meantime, I might just spend some time and tune up micro.blog styles and settings. That should be a good exercise for this evening!</p>

			 <p>This evening I find myself seriously contemplating the idea of quitting Twitter. OR at least hanging a virtual &ldquo;gone to fishing, might or might not come back&rdquo; sign on my profile. 😅</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been years since I last enjoyed using the platform. I guess it mostly feels like a distraction today. I certainly use too much screentime on it at least, with very little actual usefulness or value.</p>
<p>Just started the process of getting my tweet archive ready for download. Going to sleep on it and see what the next steps will be once the archive is ready. 🙈</p>

			 <p>After a brief <a href="https://www.juhaliikala.com/2022/04/09/back-to-micro.html">sidetracking on WordPress</a>, I switched my blogging efforts back to micro.blog. WP was fine (it always is), but the ease of publishing via micro.blog just felt like a better road to take right now. Let&rsquo;s see how this goes! :)</p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;ve been mulling over the thought of building and selling a few website / blogging themes this year. Just not 100% decided on to which &ldquo;platform&rdquo;. Probably <a href="https://ghost.org/">Ghost</a> or <a href="https://www.11ty.dev/">Eleventy</a>, or why not a micro.blog theme even? WordPress could be too, but the latest full site editing / block theme stuff feels like there&rsquo;s too many moving parts to take into account. Would want to keep things as simple as possible.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t recall if I&rsquo;ve seen commercial Eleventy themes before though. So Ghost then.. perhaps? At least Ghost has a <a href="https://ghost.org/themes/?category=paid">theme marketplace</a>.</p>
<p>Just thinking out loud here I guess. Let&rsquo;s see what I manage to cook up (if anything at all)! :)</p>

			 <p>Back to micro posting! While putting bits and pieces together <a href="https://www.juhaliikala.com/">on my personal blog</a>, I also wanted to start writing note type of (micro) posts. For me the reasoning being - that would lower the otherwise high threshold of hitting the publish button more often. So here goes! :)</p>
