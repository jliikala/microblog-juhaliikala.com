			 <p>For many years, it has been my December activity to go through those web/social media accounts that I don&rsquo;t really use much and &ldquo;cut out the fat&rdquo;. It&rsquo;s always a surprise to realize how many new places I&rsquo;ve made accounts during the past year (as I like to test new shiny things 😄).</p>
<p>This year, I&rsquo;d especially like to get the number of my social media accounts as low as possible. Ideally, I would just like to be &ldquo;present&rdquo; on my own website/blog and cut out all the rest. I feel that&rsquo;s not yet entirely viable option, although the #ActivityPub &ldquo;movement&rdquo; sure has helped get the ball rolling in that direction.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s see! At least, there&rsquo;s this one &ldquo;bird account&rdquo; that I very much think will get flushed by the end of year for me. Probably few others too. Anyone else who&rsquo;s doing a similar &ldquo;cleanup&rdquo; this year?</p>

			 <p>As micro.blog supports crossposting stuff from here to Mastodon, let&rsquo;s try that too! Curious to learn how I&rsquo;ll end up using these two side by side. I guess time and (perhaps) trial and error will tell 😅</p>

			 <p>So, I did went the route of deactivating my Twitter account a week ago, but following <a href="https://aus.social/@thedragstate/109377827512403023">this good advice</a> from <a href="https://micro.blog/thedragstate@aus.social">@thedragstate@aus.social</a>, decided to reactivate and just lock it. Let it rot. In the meanwhile, I guess I&rsquo;ll find a Mastodon instance next OR create my own. Let&rsquo;s see :)</p>

			 <p>I find that micro.blog has the same kind of good vibe Twitter used to have in the early days. Browsing and reading other people&rsquo;s updates here leave me feeling good. The opposite is true with my Twitter feed, which has turned into (mostly) doom and gloom, people arguing about stupid smallest things and all that. I&rsquo;ll be spending much more time here than on Twitter in the future, that&rsquo;s for sure! :)</p>
<p>One thing I&rsquo;ve wondered lately when discovering new users here, how many active users are there on micro.blog? Just a curiosity, if it&rsquo;s not a big secret <a href="https://micro.blog/manton">@manton</a>? 😄</p>

			 <p>And there goes the well started Daily (Micro) Blogger streak - Forgot to post yesterday, duh! Oh well.. 😄 Weekend ahead! No plans, just chill! Maybe some gym activities, movies and catching up reading from some favourite bloggers around the blogosphere. Speaking of &ldquo;reading blogs&rdquo;, I still find most convinient to subscribe to blogs via news reader, instead of email newsletters. My highest recommends goes to reader called <a href="https://netnewswire.com/">NetNewsWire</a> 🙌</p>

			 <p>Apparently the &ldquo;new hot thing&rdquo; on social media is an app called BeReal. Looked through few demo videos of usage, but haven&rsquo;t tried. Not sure I will.</p>
<p>The idea of sharing random moment daily with friends in kind of fun.. but then again, I really don&rsquo;t feel like needing yet another app in my life. Also, we have groups in various chat apps with friends where we share random moments already, so.. might be a pass for me.</p>
<p>If you&rsquo;ve tried / use it already, what are your thoughts of it?</p>

Amit sure has been blogging for a while!  Starting from 2005, that&rsquo;s no small feat! 😄 Amit is also responsible for the beautiful theme I started using on my blog (the same one he uses for his - <a href="https://github.com/am1t/microdotblog-paper">Paper theme</a>). Minimally beautiful!</p>
<p>Regarding discovering new (micro) blogs, I wonder if there&rsquo;s a way to see if anyone I follow on Twitter has a blog here? Is there a plug-in or something for that <a href="https://micro.blog/manton">@manton</a>? 😊</p>

			 <p>This evening I find myself seriously contemplating the idea of quitting Twitter. OR at least hanging a virtual &ldquo;gone to fishing, might or might not come back&rdquo; sign on my profile. 😅</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s been years since I last enjoyed using the platform. I guess it mostly feels like a distraction today. I certainly use too much screentime on it at least, with very little actual usefulness or value.</p>
<p>Just started the process of getting my tweet archive ready for download. Going to sleep on it and see what the next steps will be once the archive is ready. 🙈</p>

			 <p>I&rsquo;ve been mulling over the thought of building and selling a few website / blogging themes this year. Just not 100% decided on to which &ldquo;platform&rdquo;. Probably <a href="https://ghost.org/">Ghost</a> or <a href="https://www.11ty.dev/">Eleventy</a>, or why not a micro.blog theme even? WordPress could be too, but the latest full site editing / block theme stuff feels like there&rsquo;s too many moving parts to take into account. Would want to keep things as simple as possible.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t recall if I&rsquo;ve seen commercial Eleventy themes before though. So Ghost then.. perhaps? At least Ghost has a <a href="https://ghost.org/themes/?category=paid">theme marketplace</a>.</p>
<p>Just thinking out loud here I guess. Let&rsquo;s see what I manage to cook up (if anything at all)! :)</p>

			 <p>Back to micro posting! While putting bits and pieces together <a href="https://www.juhaliikala.com/">on my personal blog</a>, I also wanted to start writing note type of (micro) posts. For me the reasoning being - that would lower the otherwise high threshold of hitting the publish button more often. So here goes! :)</p>
